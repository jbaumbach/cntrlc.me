cntrlc.me
=========

The simple demo solves a common problem.  What do you do when you have a link on your phone and want to put it on your 
computer, or vice versa?  Usually I email it to myself, but that's a bit of a hassle.  With cntrlc.me, 
you just open the site in a browser on both devices and copy the link in.  The link instantly appears on the other 
device.  It works across any and all platforms and you don't need to install anything.

Facebook login makes security quick and easy, and no Facebook permissions are asked for.

This demo shows implementations of a "REAN" stack:

* Redis database
* Express 4 backend
* Angular.js frontend
* Node.js

With some bonus features:

* Facebook Login
* Socket.io messaging
* Mocha/Supertest tests
